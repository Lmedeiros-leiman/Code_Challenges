# What is this repository?

this is my personal repository with code challenges i have completed, ranging from LeetCode, HackerRank and CodeWars to custom challenges i found in the wild.

for LeetCode i'm originaly starting following [NeetCode's guide](https://neetcode.io/) to guide me before being able to fully solve these problems by myself.
